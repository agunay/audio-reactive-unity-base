# To clone the repository for the first time 
1. Open 'Terminal'
2. Use the command `cd <path_to_the_directory_to_contain_the_project>`
3. On GitHub, click on the green dropdown button with the text Code. Ensure SSH is selected. Copy the line. Go back to your terminal and type `git clone <paste_the_copied_line_from_github>` - if this step is successful you cloned the project successfully. You can confirm by typing `ls` in the terminal.

Alternatively you can just get it as an archived file but I suggest above steps, so you can easily pull the changes if I make further updates.
